            If I think about my first steps into web development, it would have
            been my last year at school. I was have a subject â€“ computer
            science. Usually, the teacher told us about Word, Excel, Power Point
            and stuff like that. One day, we had a class on Microsoft Publisher
            and each of the students created their own website. I had built a
            movie portal and I like it. (look the picture in the bubble) And
            after a lot of years, when I finished university and worked in
            public catering I remembered this. I decided to switch my career
            path and started to learn about web development by myself. However,
            I quickly realized that I needed a study structure and mentorship.
            So I finished courses where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            React. Now I continue my self-education and actively searching for
            my first job as a Frontend developer!
